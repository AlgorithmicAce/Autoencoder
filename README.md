# Autoencoder

***

### Autoencoder is a model in Deep Learning where the model is required to reconstruct the input with minimal loss. This is done by reducing the dimension, forcing the model to learn the features.

### Autoencoder has many use cases:
1) Anomaly Detector
2) Data Denoising
3) Data Compression 

and much more.
